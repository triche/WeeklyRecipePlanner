I want to eat two eggs as a part of every breakfast, and I don't want any vegetables at breakfast. My morning snacks can be the same every day, and my afternoon snacks can be the same every day, but I want my morning snack and my afternoon snack to be different. Lunches should be something that I can make ahead and portion out for multiple days. No Spinach. I want a different dinner every night. No cottage cheese.
